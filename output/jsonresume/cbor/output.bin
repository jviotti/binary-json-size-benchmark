He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!) Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer. While his work focuses on applied information theory, mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants, his non-work interests range widely, everything from quantum computing to chaos theory. He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a ‚Äúlength-limited‚Äù conversation!hlocation•gaddressp2712 Broadway StjpostalCodehCA 94115dcitymSan FranciscokcountryCodebUSfregionjCaliforniahprofilesÇ£gnetworkgTwitterhusernameoneutralthoughtscurl`£gnetworkjSoundCloudhusernameldandymusicnlcurlx#https://soundcloud.com/dandymusicnldworkÅßgcompanyjPied PiperhpositionmCEO/Presidentgwebsitethttp://piedpiper.comistartDatej2013-12-01gendDatej2014-12-01gsummaryxÚPied Piper is a multi-platform technology based on a proprietary universal compression algorithm that has consistently fielded high Weisman Scores‚Ñ¢ that are not merely competitive, but approach the theoretical limit of lossless compression.jhighlightsÉxaBuild an algorithm for artist to detect if their music was violating copy right infringement lawsx#Successfully won Techcrunch DisruptxMOptimized an algorithm that holds the current world record for Weisman ScoresivolunteerÅßlorganizationiCoderDojohpositiongTeachergwebsiteuhttp://coderdojo.com/istartDatej2012-01-01gendDatej2013-01-01gsummaryx6Global movement of free coding clubs for young people.jhighlightsÅxAwarded 'Teacher of the Month'ieducationÅßkinstitutionvUniversity of OklahomadareavInformation TechnologyistudyTypehBacheloristartDatej2011-06-01gendDatej2014-01-01cgpac4.0gcoursesÇrDB1101 - Basic SQLxCS2011 - Java IntroductionfawardsÅ§etitlex!Digital Compression Pioneer Awardddatej2014-11-01gawarderjTechcrunchgsummaryrThere is no spoon.lpublicationsÅ•dnamexVideo compression for 3d mediaipublishereHoolikreleaseDatej2014-10-01gwebsitex7http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)gsummaryxOInnovative middle-out compression algorithm that changes the way we store data.fskillsÇ£dnameoWeb DevelopmentelevelfMasterhkeywordsÉdHTMLcCSSjJavascript£dnamekCompressionelevelfMasterhkeywordsÉdMpegcMP4cGIFilanguagesÅ¢hlanguagegEnglishgfluencynNative speakeriinterestsÅ¢dnamehWildlifehkeywordsÇgFerretshUnicornsjreferencesÅ¢dnamenErlich BachmanireferencexüIt is my pleasure to recommend Richard, his performance working as a consultant for Main St. Company proved that he will be a valuable addition to any company.
