He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!) Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer. While his work focuses on applied information theory, mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants, his non-work interests range widely, everything from quantum computing to chaos theory. He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a â€œlength-limitedâ€ conversation!¨location…§address°2712 Broadway StªpostalCode¨CA 94115¤city­San Francisco«countryCode¢US¦regionªCalifornia¨profiles’ƒ§network§Twitter¨username¯neutralthoughts£url ƒ§networkªSoundCloud¨username¬dandymusicnl£urlÙ#https://soundcloud.com/dandymusicnl¤work‘‡§companyªPied Piper¨position­CEO/President§website´http://piedpiper.com©startDateª2013-12-01§endDateª2014-12-01§summaryÙòPied Piper is a multi-platform technology based on a proprietary universal compression algorithm that has consistently fielded high Weisman Scoresâ„¢ that are not merely competitive, but approach the theoretical limit of lossless compression.ªhighlights“ÙaBuild an algorithm for artist to detect if their music was violating copy right infringement lawsÙ#Successfully won Techcrunch DisruptÙMOptimized an algorithm that holds the current world record for Weisman Scores©volunteer‘‡¬organization©CoderDojo¨position§Teacher§websiteµhttp://coderdojo.com/©startDateª2012-01-01§endDateª2013-01-01§summaryÙ6Global movement of free coding clubs for young people.ªhighlights‘¾Awarded 'Teacher of the Month'©education‘‡«institution¶University of Oklahoma¤area¶Information Technology©studyType¨Bachelor©startDateª2011-06-01§endDateª2014-01-01£gpa£4.0§courses’²DB1101 - Basic SQLºCS2011 - Java Introduction¦awards‘„¥titleÙ!Digital Compression Pioneer Award¤dateª2014-11-01§awarderªTechcrunch§summary²There is no spoon.¬publications‘…¤name¾Video compression for 3d media©publisher¥Hooli«releaseDateª2014-10-01§websiteÙ7http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)§summaryÙOInnovative middle-out compression algorithm that changes the way we store data.¦skills’ƒ¤name¯Web Development¥level¦Master¨keywords“¤HTML£CSSªJavascriptƒ¤name«Compression¥level¦Master¨keywords“¤Mpeg£MP4£GIF©languages‘‚¨language§English§fluency®Native speaker©interests‘‚¤name¨Wildlife¨keywords’§Ferrets¨Unicornsªreferences‘‚¤name®Erlich Bachman©referenceÙŸIt is my pleasure to recommend Richard, his performance working as a consultant for Main St. Company proved that he will be a valuable addition to any company.
