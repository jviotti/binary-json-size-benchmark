He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!) Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer. While his work focuses on applied information theory, mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants, his non-work interests range widely, everything from quantum computing to chaos theory. He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a â€œlength-limitedâ€ conversation!üAORichard Hendriks‡profilesøú†networkFTwitter‡usernameNneutralthoughts‚url ûúWISoundCloudXKdandymusicnlYbhttps://soundcloud.com/dandymusicnlûù‡locationú†addressO2712 Broadway St‰postalCodeGCA 94115ƒcityLSan FranciscoŠcountryCodeAUS…regionICaliforniaû„phoneM(912) 555-4321†picture û…awardsøú„title`Digital Compression Pioneer AwardƒdateI2014-11-01†awarderITechcrunchHQThere is no spoon.ûùˆvolunteerøú‹organizationHCoderDojo‡positionFTeacherGThttp://coderdojo.com/MI2012-01-01NI2013-01-01HuGlobal movement of free coding clubs for young people.‰highlightsø]Awarded 'Teacher of the Month'ùûùˆlanguagesøú‡languageFEnglish†fluencyMNative speakerûùˆinterestsøúAGWildlifeCøFFerretsGUnicornsùûùƒworkøú†companyIPied PiperhLCEO/PresidentGShttp://piedpiper.comMI2013-12-01NI2014-12-01HäPied Piper is a multi-platform technology based on a proprietary universal compression algorithm that has consistently fielded high Weisman Scoresâ„¢ that are not merely competitive, but approach the theoretical limit of lossless compression.üiøàBuild an algorithm for artist to detect if their music was violating copy right infringement lawsübSuccessfully won Techcrunch DisruptàOptimized an algorithm that holds the current world record for Weisman Scoresüùûùû
